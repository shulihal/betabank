# Betabank
Beta Bank customers are leaving: little by little, chipping away every month. The bankers figured out it’s cheaper to save the existing customers rather than to attract new ones.
We need to predict whether a customer will leave the bank soon. You have the data on clients’ past behavior and termination of contracts with the bank.
